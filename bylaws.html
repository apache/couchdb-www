<h1>CouchDB Bylaws</h1>

<p><em>This document was officially adopted by the CouchDB PMC as of 31 July 2014.</em></p>
<p>A full changelog is available <a href="https://github.com/apache/couchdb-www/commits/asf-site/bylaws.html">on GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2>Table of contents</h2>

<div class="toc"></div>

<h2 id="intro">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>This document defines the bylaws under which the Apache CouchDB project operates. It describes the <a href="#roles">roles and responsibilities</a> within the project, who may vote, how <a href="#voting">voting</a> works, how to resolve conflicts, and specifies voting rules for specific <a href="#types">decision types</a>.

<p>This document is for anyone who wishes to participate in the project. <strong>If this is your first time through this document, read this introduction, then read all the bolded text for a summary of the bylaws.</strong> Then, as you want, read past the bolded text for an expanded explanation.

<p>CouchDB is a project of the <em>Apache Software Foundation</em> (ASF). Apache CouchDB, CouchDB, and the CouchDB logo are trademarks of the ASF. We license the project resources to the public under the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html">Apache License 2.0</a>. We make releases in the form of officially signed source code archives. The <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/faq.html">ASF FAQ</a> explains the operation and background of the foundation.

<p>CouchDB operates under a set of shared principles known collectively as <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html"><em>the Apache Way</em></a>:

  <ul>
    <li>Collaborative software development
    <li>Commercial-friendly standard license
    <li>Consistently high-quality software
    <li>Respectful, honest, technical-based interaction
    <li>Faithful implementation of standards
    <li>Security as a mandatory feature
  </ul>

<p>We value the community more than the code. A healthy community should be a fun and rewarding place for everyone involved. A healthy community will produce written code (and everything else) over time. The same is not true in reverse.

<p>The direction of the project and the decisions we make are up to you. If you are participating on <a href="https://couchdb.apache.org/#mailing-lists">the mailing lists</a>, you have the right to make decisions. We make all decisions about the project on the mailing lists. There are no lead developers, nor is there any one person in charge.

<p>Anyone can subscribe to the public mailing lists, and in fact, you are encouraged to do so. The development mailing list is not just for developers, for instance. It is for anyone interested in the development of the project. Everybody's voice is welcome.

<p>Finally, the use of these bylaws to enforce the letter of any rule and not its spirit (also known as "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_lawyer">rule lawyering</a>") is not acceptable behavior.

<h2 id="roles">2. Roles and responsibilities</h2>

<p><strong>The ASF <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#roles">defines a set of roles</a> with associated rights and responsibilities. These roles govern what tasks an individual may perform within the project. The roles are described in the following sections.</strong>

<p>Your role is bestowed on you by your peers in recognition of your past contributions to the project and your position of trust within the community. It is not tied to your job, your current employer, or your current activity level. We are interested in you as an individual, and we understand that your interactions with the project may change over time.

<p>Roles are never rescinded because of inactivity—unless that inactivity is causing a problem for the project. Fortunately, our decision-making process means that inactivity is very rarely a problem. Roles will be rescinded if the <a href="#pmc">Project Management Committee</a> (or <a href="#pmc">PMC</a>, see 2.4. below) believes the individual is no longer able to discharge the duty of the role responsibly.

<p>We understand that you have many roles in life. We use a hat metaphor to talk about these roles. For instance, you might have your work hat as well as several ASF hats. We expect you to know when to wear the appropriate hat, and to comport yourself in a manner befitting the interests of the foundation when interacting with the project. Failure to do this is considered a severe dereliction of duty.

<p>Sometimes it is a good idea to tell people which hat you are wearing. For instance, the PMC chair might start an informal email by explicitly stating that they are not wearing the PMC chair's hat. Doing so can help to clear up the meaning (and implication) of what is said.

<p>We expect you to act in good faith. Doing so is very important for a community that depends so heavily on trust.

<h3 id="users">2.1. Users</h3>

<p><strong>The most critical participants in the project are people who use our software.</strong>

<p>Users can participate by talking about the project, providing feedback, and helping others. Participation can be done at the ASF or elsewhere and includes being active on the user mailing list, third-party support forums, blogs, and social media. Users who participate in this way become contributors automatically.

<h3 id="contributors">2.2. Contributors</h3>

<p><strong>A contributor is someone who makes contributions to the community, project, documentation, or code.</strong>

<p>There is no special requirement to become a contributor. If you have a good idea for the project, you can get to work immediately. There is no need to ask permission. Contributors can accomplish most things with no special privileges or status on the project. We will assist you if you need access to project resources to get your work done.

<p>A contributor who makes sustained contributions to the project may be invited to become a committer.

<h3 id="committers">2.3. Committers</h3>

<p><strong>A committer is someone who is committed to the project. In return for your commitment, we give you a binding vote in some specific types of project decision. Committers are hence responsible for the ongoing health of the project and the community.</strong>

<p>We recognize commitment in many different areas. These include, but are not limited to:

  <ul>
    <li>Community (e.g., community management, ticket triage, helping new users, and helping with events)
    <li>Project (e.g., blogging, marketing, design, UX, and branding)
    <li>Documentation (e.g., documentation, localisation, and internationalisation)
    <li>Code (e.g., new features, bug fixing, quality assurance, and release management)
  </ul>

<p>More details are available in <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/COUCHDB/Contributor+Guide">the contributor guide</a>. If any of these things sound interesting to you, we welcome your help.

<p>The ASF mandates the role of committer. Unfortunately, the usual definition of that word—being someone who commits code—can mean that projects fail to give binding votes to non-coders. We think that's a problem. Contributions come in many shapes and sizes. Indeed, many of those non-code contributions are what the project needs the most.

<p>To make this clear, we have chosen to define a committer as someone who is <em>committed</em>. We mean this in the sense of being loyal to the project and its interests. It is a position of trust, not an expectation of activity level. We will consider anyone supportive of the community and the project for the role of committer.

<p>As a matter of convenience, we also give committers write access to all of the public project infrastructure, including source control repositories, website, issue tracker, wiki, and blog. We will grant access to social media accounts and other third-party services on request.

<p>All committers are required to have a signed <em>Individual Contributor License Agreement</em> (ICLA) on file. There is an <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/committers.html">ASF FAQ</a> which provides more details about the requirements at the foundation-level.

<p>Committers are expected to work cooperatively and have good social skills. Social skills are more important than any other sort of skill. Our committers make up the bulk of our active community, and as such, we rely on them to help us build and maintain that community.

<p>A committer who makes a sustained contribution to the project may be invited to become a <em>Project Management Committee</em> (PMC) member.

<h3 id="pmc">2.4. Project Management Committee</h3>

<p><strong>The <em>Project Management Committee</em> (PMC) is responsible for the management of the project.</strong>

<p>At the most basic level, the role of the PMC is to provide oversight. The PMC must ensure that the project adheres to all the relevant bylaws, policies, and procedures. These exist at the foundation-level and the project-level. See the <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/COUCHDB/Project+affairs">project affairs</a> page for more information.

<p>Additionally, the PMC must invest in the long term wellbeing of the community. For this reason, one of the most basic tasks the PMC should undertake is the recruitment and management of project contributors. We believe that the size, diversity, and health of the community is essential for the quality, stability, and robustness of the project and its social structures.

<p>Activities of the PMC include, but are not limited to:

  <ul>
    <li>Project governance
    <li>Community management
    <li>Release management
    <li>Complying with legal guidelines
    <li>Managing confidentially-reported security issues
    <li>Branding and events coordination
    <li>Press and analyst relations
  </ul>

<p>We hold PMC members to a much higher standard than regular community members. For example, strict hat wearing, equitable decision making, and exemplary conduct. People look to PMC members for cues about how to behave. It is essential that all PMC members understand the responsibility they bear are individually committed to improving themselves and the project.

<p>While security issues and release management are the responsibility of the PMC, the PMC typically delegates this to committers.

<h3 id="chair">2.5. Chair</h3>

<p><strong>The project chair is a PMC member responsible for foundation-level administrative tasks.</strong> It is not a technical leadership position, meaning the chair has no special say in ordinary project decisions. However, we do think of it as a cultural leadership position. Accordingly, position on cultural issues is something to consider when electing a chair.

<p>The PMC elect the chair, but the board must officially appoint them with a board resolution. The chair is an officer of the ASF (with an official title of <em>Vice President, Apache CouchDB</em>) and has a primary responsibility to the board for the management of the project. The chair is the eyes and ears of the board, and reports quarterly on developments within the project.

<p>The chair is a facilitator, and their role within the PMC is to ensure that everyone has a chance to be heard and to enable meetings to flow smoothly.

<p>If the current chair resigns, or the term of the chair expires, the PMC will hold a chair election.

<p>The chair has a 12-month term. The allows for a rotation of the role amongst the PMC members. However, the PMC may select the same chair to serve consecutive terms.

<h3 id="board">2.6. Board of Directors</h3>

<p><strong>The chair is responsible for the project to the Board of Directors (the board) of the ASF.</strong> The board is the nine-person legal governing body of the ASF, elected by the <a href="http://apache.org/foundation/members.html">members</a> of the foundation. The board provides the oversight for the foundation and has the responsibility of upholding the <a href="http://apache.org/foundation/bylaws.html">ASF's bylaws</a>.

<h2 id="decisions">3. Decision making</h2>

<p>This section explains our approach to decision making and the formal structures we have in place to make this as easy as possible.

<p><strong>In descending order of preference, we prefer to make decisions via:</strong>

  <ul>
    <li><strong><a href="#lazy">Lazy consensus</a> or <a href="#rtc">RTC</a></strong>
    <li><strong><a href="#discussions">Discussion-led consensus gathering</a></strong>
    <li><strong><a href="#voting">Formal voting</a></strong>
  </ul>

<p>Our goal is to build a community of trust, reduce mailing list traffic, and deal with disagreements swiftly when they occur.

<p>All decision making must happen on <a href="https://couchdb.apache.org/#mailing-lists">the mailing lists</a>. You must bring any discussion that takes place away from the lists (e .g., on IRC or in person) back to the lists before making any decisions. We have a saying: "if it's not on the lists, it didn't happen." We take this approach so that the most amount of people have a chance to participate.

<p>Please try to make decisions on the mailing list most appropriate for the decision. For example, marketing decisions should happen on <a href="https://lists.apache.org/list.html?marketing@couchdb.apache.org">the marketing list</a>. If no specific list exists for the type of decision you want to make, take it to the main development list. If it's a private matter, take it to the private list.

<p>Our decision-making processes are designed to reduce blockages. We understood that people come and go as time permits. It is not practical to hear from everybody on every decision. Sometimes, this means we will decide something while you are away from the project. You may bring up decisions up for re-discussion if you want—but please try to keep this to a minimum.

<h3 id="lazy">3.1. Lazy consensus</h3>

<p><strong>When you feel convinced you know what the community would like to see happen, you can assume that you already have permission and get on with the work. We call this <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/glossary.html#LazyConsensus">lazy consensus</a>.</strong> You don't have to insist that people discuss or approve your plan, and you certainly don't need to call a vote. Just assume your plan is okay unless someone says otherwise. This principle applies to anything in the list of <a href="#types">decision types</a> in section 3.6 that allows lazy consensus.

  <blockquote>
    "It's easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission." — Grace Hopper
  </blockquote>

<p>Most actions are reversible. As long as you do your work in the open, the community has plenty of opportunities to object. If someone does object, you must be prepared to roll back your work.

<p>Lazy consensus has two effects:

  <ol>
    <li>People are less likely to object for the sake of it
    <li>It cuts down on the amount of unnecessary discussion
  </ol>

<p>For this to work, active committers are expected to be paying attention to the project. Objecting a long time after the project has made a change may require large amounts of additional work to be thrown away or redone.

<p>Sometimes, you might not be sure what the community would want. If this is the case, you can post a note to the appropriate <a href="https://couchdb.apache.org/#mailing-lists">mailing list</a> with an outline of what you intend to do. If nobody objects after 72 hours, you can safely assume consensus and proceed with your plan.

<p>A corollary of this policy is that <em>silence is assent</em>. There is no need for discussion and no need for any agreement to be voiced. If you propose something to the list and nobody responds, you can interpret that as implicit support for your idea, and not a lack of interest. This principle can be hard to get used to—but it is an essential ingredient of how we operate.

<h3 id="discussion">3.2. Discussion</h3>

<p><strong>If lazy consensus fails (i.e., someone objects) you can start a conversation, or you can abandon the proposal.</strong>

<p>Please try to be respectful of people's time and attention. It is a non-renewable resource and the only thing we always need more of.

<p>Proposals should be explained clearly and come with adequate justification. Disagreements should be constructive and ideally come with alternative suggestions. The goal is to reach a positive outcome for the project, not convince others of your opinion.

<p>If a proposal is particularly controversial, try making it reversible. Reframe the proposition as an experiment (either at the project level or the feature level) and identify a timeline for evaluation along with unambiguous success and failure criteria. These sorts of proposals are usually much easier to agree on.

<p>If a clear consensus emerges, you can proceed without a vote. Otherwise, you should abandon the proposal or move to a vote.

<p>Voting is a failure mode of discussion. However, that doesn't mean you should avoid it. Voting is a potent tool that should be used to terminate a seemingly interminable debate. Knowing when to end a discussion and call a vote is one of the most useful skills a contributor can master.

<h3 id="voting">3.3. Voting</h3>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html">Votes</a> are used to indicate approval or disapproval of something.</strong>

<p>We do this by replying with a signed number, usually +1 or -1. Occasionally people choose to vote with larger values (e.g., +1000) to indicate strong feelings, or in fractional values (e.g., -0.5) to convey support or disagreement without the full weight of a +1 or -1 vote. For the purpose of tallying, we count all values as +1, -1, or nothing.

<p>Here are some example votes, with what they mean, and how we would count them in the final vote tally:</p>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Vote
      <th>Meaning
      <th>Counted As
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>+1000
      <td>"Wow, this is great. Let's do it!"
      <td>+1
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>+1
      <td>"I like this idea."
      <td>+1
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>+0.5
      <td>"Seems okay, but I'm not entirely convinced."
      <td>—
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>+0
      <td>"Not convinced, but doesn't seem harmful."
      <td>—
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>-0
      <td>"Not convinced, and seems harmful."
      <td>—
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>-0.5
      <td>"Not happy, but won't block this."
      <td>—
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>-1
      <td>"Not happy, and I want to prevent this from happening."
      <td>-1
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>-1000
      <td>"Extremely unhappy with this proposal."
      <td>-1
    </tr>
  </table>

<p>There are three types of voting: informal, formal, and vetos. An informal vote is a quick way to get people's feelings about something. A formal vote, on the other hand, requires an approval model and a <a href="#decisions">decision type</a>. More detail on <a href="#approval">approval models</a>, <a href="#rtc">RTC and technical vetos</a>, <a href="#rfc">RFCs</a>, <a href="#api">API changes and deprecations</a>, and <a href="#types">decision types</a> is available in the following sections.

<p>You must conduct all formal voting in an email thread with the appropriate <a href="#tags">subject tag</a>. Formal votes may contain multiple items for approval, and these should be separated clearly. Formal voting is then carried out by replying to the vote mail. Formal votes are open for a period of at least 72 hours to allow all active voters time to consider the vote. Votes can be held open longer than this at the discretion of the person who initiated the vote.

<p>Votes on <a href="#types">PMC decisions</a> are binding if a PMC member casts them. For all other purposes, votes are binding if a committer casts them. However, it is essential to remember that all participants on a list get a vote. Moreover, you are encouraged to vote, even if your vote is not binding. Voting is an excellent way to get involved in the project and helps to inform the decision-making process.

<p>You are encouraged to use an informal voting model to take a quick poll or to wrap up a discussion, whether you are a committer yet or not. Anyone can initiate these votes.

<h3 id="approval">3.4. Approval models</h3>

<p><strong>We use three different approval models for formal voting</strong>:

  <ul>
    <li>RTC (see section 3.5)
      <ul>
	<li>Requires one binding +1 vote and no vetos
      </ul>
    <li>Lazy majority
      <ul>
	<li>Requires three binding +1 votes and more binding +1 votes than binding -1 votes
      </ul>
    <li>Lazy 2/3 majority
      <ul>
	<li>Requires three binding +1 votes and twice as many binding +1 votes as binding -1 votes
      </ul>
  </ul>

<p>RTC is only ever used in the context of a code review or a pull request and does not require a separate vote thread. Each of the other approval models requires a vote thread.

<p>A -1 vote is never called a veto except when using the RTC approval model because a single -1 vote never has the power to block a vote outside of RTC.

<p>Which approval model to use is dictated by the table in section 3.6.

<p>For electing a new chair, the PMC may opt to use <em>Single Transferable Vote</em> (STV) which comes with its own rules. You can use <a href="http://steve.apache.org/">Apache STeVe</a> for STF votes.

<h3 id="rtc">3.5. Review-then-commit and technical vetos</h3>

<p>Typically, CouchDB uses the <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/glossary.html#ReviewThenCommit">Review-Then-Commit</a> (<em>RTC</em>) model of code collaboration. RTC allows work to proceed on non-release branches and requires at least one other developer to review and approve the changes before they are committed to a release branch. A release branch is any branch the project can use to prepare a release, such as <code>master</code> or <code>1.6.x</code>. Notifications of these changes are sent to <a href="https://lists.apache.org/list.html?commits@couchdb.apache.org">the commits mailing list</a>, with GitHub discussion appearing on <a href="https://lists.apache.org/list.html?notifications@couchdb.apache.org">the notifications mailing list</a>. We expect the community to review these changes regularly.

<p><strong>Any change made to a release branch or the <code>master</code> branch is a <em>technical decision</em> of the project. If a committer wants to object to a technical decision, they have the option of casting a -1 vote. We call this a veto.</strong> You can only veto for technical reasons. A -1 vote is not considered a veto in any other context. Vetos should be used sparingly, and only after careful consideration.

<p>All vetoes must be justified, and vetoes without justification are null and void. You can challenge the validity of a veto justification, and the project will decide the outcome with a vote. If the justification is valid, a veto cannot be overruled and stands until withdrawn by the caster. If you disagree with a veto, you must lobby the person casting the veto to withdraw their veto. If the caster does not withdraw their veto, the offending commit must be promptly reverted.

<p>Here's how a veto might lead to a code revert:

  <ul>
    <li>Abe commits a change
    <li>Beth spots the change and realizes that it's going to cause a major problem
    <li>Beth replies to the commit email with a -1 vote and a justification
    <li>A discussion ensues, leading to consensus
    <li>Abe reverts the change
  </ul>

<p>If the parties do not reach an agreement, Abe could challenge the validity of Beth's justification. At that point, the PMC would vote on the issue. If the PMC found that the justification was valid, Abe would have to revert the change or petition Beth to withdraw the veto. If the PMC found the justification invalid, the veto is null and void.

<h3 id="rfc">3.6 Request For Comment (RFC) process</h3>

<p>We have established a Request For Comment (RFC) process for major changes to the functionality of CouchDB. An RFC intends to ensure sufficient discussion has occurred, that the proposal is adequately captured in a summary document, and that there is community acceptance of the plan. The completed RFC template then becomes the basis for the new functionality's documentation.</p>

<p>The process is:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Start a [DISCUSS] thread on <a href="https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@couchdb.apache.org">the developer mailing list</a>. Discuss your proposal in detail, including which modules/applications are affected, any HTTP API additions and deprecations, and security issues.</li>
    <li>When there is consensus on the approach, <a href="https://s.apache.org/CouchDB-RFC">complete the RFC template</a>, and work through any final revisions to the document with the support of the developer mailing list.</li>
    <li>Start the RFC <strong>vote</strong> on the developer mailing list. Hold the vote according to the <em>lazy majority process</em>: at least 3 +1 votes, and more binding +1 votes than binding -1 votes.</li>
  </ul>

<h3 id="api">3.7 API changes and deprecations</h3>

<p>Before you make a change to a release branch that removes or changes an existing HTTP API endpoint in a way that breaks backward compatibility with a released version of CouchDB,  you <em>must</em> propose the change on the <a href="https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@couchdb.apache.org">developer mailing list</a>. A minimum of a <a href="#lazy">lazy consensus</a> is required to proceed.</strong>

<p>This policy is not intended to preserve bugs in HTTP API endpoints across released versions of CouchDB in perpetuity, nor shall it be used to assert consistency of undocumented, implementation-specific behavior across major releases. The addition of new endpoints that fall short of the need for an RFC, or changes that do not affect backward compatibility, do not require that you go through this process. However, proposing the change is still strongly encouraged.</p>

<h3 id="types">3.8. Decision types</h3>

<h3 id="tags">4.1. Subject tags</h3>

<p><strong>A subject tag is a string like "[TAG]" that appears at the start of an email subject. We use these to communicate the type of message being sent.</strong>

<p>Here's what an example subject looks like, using multiple tags:

  <blockquote>
    <code>[VOTE] [REVISED] Official CouchDB bylaws</code>
  </blockquote>

<p>If a VOTE or PROPOSAL thread is started without the requisite tag, you can challenge its validity. Every other tag is optional.

<p>We have agreed on the following tags, but you are free to coin your own.</p>
